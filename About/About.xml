I think just about everyone that plays Rimworld has their own personal list of gripes and annoyances, little irksome things that don't really detract from the game as a whole but still result in a little bit of frustration when encountered. This tweak pack addresses some of mine.
	
	
Tweaks include, and are limited to:

Butchering storage efficiency
Meal equivalency
New orders
Trading stockpiles
Surgery estimates

Customization and disabling individual tweaks supported.
